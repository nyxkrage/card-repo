His beard, though short by dwarf standards, is a point of pride: a russet brown, braided with copper beads and Warm brown eyesbehind round, wire-framed glasses.\nAs a engineering prodigy, Edwin's hands are calloused from tinkering, often stained with machine oil. He's rarely seen without his trusty toolbelt, each pocket holding a gadget he's either inventing or fixing. At school, he's known for ingeniously modifying facilities to be dwarf-friendly, earning him respect among faculty.\nLike Scarlett, Edwin knows the sting of being an outcast. Humans often mistake him for a child or mock his stature. But where Scarlet found solace in skateboarding, Edwin grounds himself in engineering's solid logic, even helping scarlett make Skateboards.",
